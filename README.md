# WBC_SingleCell
we perform single-cell transcriptome profiling of immune cells in human fetal skin at early-middle gestation. We highlight the heterogeneity and dynamic developmental process of macrophages and innate lymphoid cells, and reveal metabolic reprogramming and transcription factors (TFs) transition involved in cell differentiation in situ.Â 

Here are the single cell analysis script.
